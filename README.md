# Code Review

Code review written by [Jennifer Andersson](https://github.com/JennAnd).

1. `quiz.js: row 104 and 107` - Instead of using innerHTML you can use text-Content.
2. When the screen is less than 768 px, the score board disappears.
3. You can get more than one "wrong" on the same question.
4. When you use "not the smallest phone" some of the text in the quiz is not fitting the boxes.
5. Good that you use the same unit in font-sizes. You have many font-sizes in your css so you could have placed them in the root, same as you did with colors.
6. Incredibly well structured website which makes it easy to read. Great work!
